Smart contract em solidity para venda de energia eletrica.
The project is practical and functional. I made a hardware combination that involves the ESP8266 module and raspberry pi to manage the real world connection to the power grid with a blockchain network. This is the a smart contract made in Solidity to manage energy that i used in this project.
                       Any questions related to the Hardware I made can be sent via email. Here i present only the simple blockchain system.
